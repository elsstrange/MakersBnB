# MakersBnB

## Specification
A space hire application where hosts who have spaces available to book for a night can list them and receive booking requests from prospective guests. Hosts and guests must both register with the application.

Listings offer useful information about the space and its availability.

Guests make requests to book a space for a single night at a time, and Hosts will have the option to accept or reject the booking request.

User stories are available via the [repository Project tab](https://github.com/elsstrange/MakersBnB/projects/1).
